# ederg_lab
My lab is build with GNS3 and the networkdevices I use, run on IOSv-Images from virl.
I use the Linux-Subsystem-Ubuntu18.04 on Windows10.
If some things dont work in Linuxsubsystem, I run a Ubuntu Workstation in GNS3 and here I can reache all nets over the virtual infrastructur.
Ansible 2.7 run on the subsystem with all my tested playbooks.
